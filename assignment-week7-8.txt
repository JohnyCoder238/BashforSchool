Assignment of 7th and 8th week 

Introduction into a Perl language is for instance here

https://www.perltutorial.org/  and at least read it till "do until" lecture.

Now, there are questions to be evaluated from attached file.

And for the 8th week we will make another things.

Assignment of 8th week:
tzv.  Sieve of Eratosthenes i.e. to find prime numbers till n=30 

To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:
Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
Initially, let p equal 2, the smallest prime number.
Enumerate the multiples of p by counting in increments of p from 2p to n, and mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, ...; the p itself should not be marked).
Find the smallest number in the list greater than p that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.
