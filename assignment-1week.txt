   	ctrl+o ctrl+x
   18. Find line number N in the file

   	ln -s file.txt linktofile.txt
   20. Create hard link to a file

   21. Find where the link points to
   	ls -l
   22. Create a link to directory
   	ln -s directory linkdir 
   23. Explain the difference between 19 and 20

   	command > output.txt 2> error.txt
   28. Drop a stream (cancelling the redirecting)
   	Ctrl+c
   29. Find a file in directory
   	find / [-name/-iname] filename.txt 2>/dev/null
   30. Check if file exists
   	test -f file.txt
   	echo $?
   31. Check if x is directory
   	test -d file.txt
   	echo $?
   32. Check if x is a file, exists, and is not-empty
