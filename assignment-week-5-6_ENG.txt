For the next two weeks we aim to learn some basics of awk and sed.

Week one:

Learn awk and sed from the following links:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/index.htm
https://www.theunixschool.com/2011/01/sed-include-or-append-line-to-file.html


Week two:

1. Calculate the difference in time (in seconds) when two arbitrary files were created on disk 
   using awk.

2. Use system environment in awk, e.g. command date

3. How do you use an already defined variable i=6 in a listing of every 7 column from 7 to 21st column... of some file
awk '{i=6; for (j = i+1; j <= 21; j+=7) arr[j/7]=j; print $arr[1] "\t" $arr[2] "\t" $arr[3]}' filename.txt


4. How do insert two columns of data before the third column of data from the last column
awk -v OFS='\t' '{$(NF-3)=$(NF-3)"\tfirstcol\tsecondcol"} 1' filename.txt

5. Sample file
Item1,300
Item2,600
Item3,1100
Item2,700
Item1,450

Now, distribute the variables so, that the ones in second column that are larger than 650 will go into file Max.txt and the ones lower than 650 into file Min.txt.
awk -v FS=',' '{if ($2>=650) print > "max.txt"; else print > "min.txt"}' samplefile.txt


6. Sample  file  
Header 
HP  
NEC  
SGI
CRAY
AMD 
ATOS
Footer 

Split the file items for every second line without the first and last line in new single files.
sed '$d' samplefile2.txt | awk '{FN="file"i++".txt"}; {if (NR!=1) print >FN}'
